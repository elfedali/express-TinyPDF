# ðŸ“‘ Tiny PDF Compressor API

A simple **PDF compression API** built with **Node.js, Express, and Multer**.  
This API allows users to **upload** a PDF file, compress it, and store the original & compressed files in an organized folder structure.

- It uses `compress-pdf` for high-efficiency PDF compression and `multer` for file uploads.
- It is based on `ghostscript` and it is a very efficient way to compress pdf files.
